# Multiple Time Series Forecasting Shiny App
> Shiny App that highlights a few findings I made when forecasting multiple time series with **modeltime** and **tidymodels**, two great packages for Time Series forecasting in R. Data came from the **timetk** package and hopefully, this app and framework can be applied to other time series datasets.

## General Information
Training several methods on multiple time series at once using R

## Technologies Used
- R
- modeltime
- tidymodels
- Shiny

## Features
List the ready features here:
- How to apply several ML and traditional time series forecasting methods (Random Forest, SVM, ARIMA, XGBoost, Prophet, and others)
- Showcase a quick way of communicating/evaluating results for each individual time series
- Aggregate forecasts to simulate a retail company forecasting sales for many departmens/groups.

<!--## Screenshots

## Usage
* .rds files contain data
* .Rmd contains code for Shiny app
  
1. Place .rds and .Rmd files within the same folder
2. Run .Rmd once you have all packages installed.

## Project Status
_no longer being worked on_: on the to-do list for improvement

## Room for Improvement
- Adding some more time series
- Improving Feature Engineering
- Adding Deep Learning algorithms
