# Time Series Multiple Forecasting Shiny App

<img src="https://github.com/rafabelokurows/TimeSeriesForecastingApp/blob/master/forecasting.png">

For a live demo, hosted at shinyapps.io: [Time Series Multiple Forecasting](https://rafabelokurows.shinyapps.io/TimeSeriesPrediction/?_ga=2.257207563.1444425787.1641832992-1085722634.1641321539)

Shiny App that highlights a few findings I made when forecasting multiple timeseries with **modeltime** and **tidymodels**, two great packages for Time Series forecasting in R. The data used came from the timetk package and hopefully, this app and framework can be applied to other time series datasets.  

A brief summary of what you'll find here:

- How to apply several ML and traditional time series forecasting methods (Random Forest, SVM, ARIMA, XGBoost, Prophet, and others)
- Showcase a quick way of communicating/evaluating results for each individual time series
- Aggregate forecasts to simulate a retail company forecasting sales for many departmens/groups.

Updates soon to come!

## Ideas for next versions:  

- Adding some more time series
- Adding features
- Adding Deep Learning algorithms
